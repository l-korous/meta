Features
	Multi-user collaborative development
	Version management
	Compatible with leading technology in DWH
	specification is technology agnostic
	Connects to Metadata repositories using standard interfaces (APIs, JDBC/ODBC, Xls, csv)
	Adapt to existing metadata interface data format
	Supports Document generation
	Supports test scripts generation
	Future proof â€“ possibility to extend with change in technology (New features of Teradata, Informatica)
	Integrates with existing re-usable artefacts
	Work with access control

Input
	ER model
		basic templates provided
	Users&Roles
		users need to provide their e-mail
		basic set of Roles (& 1 User per Role) provided
	Specific metadata
		permissions (R/W for Object X Role)
			For MVP only global R/W is enough
		
Output
	DB structures
		SCD4
		Users&Roles
			Passwords (e-mailed) / LDAP
		Grants
		
	API
		Password change (!not if LDAP used)
		
		
Must-have
	SSL for API
	SCD4
	
Could-have
	Full RACI implementation
	
Excluded for MVP
	Other forms of versioning than SCD4
    Composite FOREIGN KEYS
    FILESTREAMS, XML
    STORAGE and other TABLE-level specification
	Other CONSTRAINTS than FKs
    Spaces and special characters in column names not supported
    Non-PK-tables (would require other versioning)
    PKs must not be FKs (this will probably hold for eternity as it is ridiculous, namely with ON UPDATE CASCADE)
    FKs must point to PKs
    ON UPDATE not effectively used due to API design and point (FKs must point to PKs)
    => ON UPDATE not used at all
    
Must be figured out
	LDAP
	Backup (import / export)
	Data handling when model changes
