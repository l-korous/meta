- Other forms of versioning than SCD4
- Composite FOREIGN KEYS
- FILESTREAMS, XML
- STORAGE and other TABLE-level specification
- Other CONSTRAINTS than FKs
- Spaces and special characters in column names not supported
- Non-PK-tables (would require other versioning)
- PKs must not be FKs (this will probably hold for eternity as it is ridiculous, namely with ON UPDATE CASCADE)
- FKs must point to PKs
- ON UPDATE not effectively used due to API design and point (FKs must point to PKs)
